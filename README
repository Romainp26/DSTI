Creation of a common Virtual Private Cloud Architecture using AWS.
Technologies used : AWS, Putty, WINSCP

The Private CLoud is composed of two subnets :
  - Public Subnet
  - Private Subnet
It is also composed of 3 instances : 
  - Instance1 and Instance2(NAT instance) in the public subnet
  - Instance3 in the private subnet
 
We want to connect to Instance3 from Instance1 in order to ping google.com
After creating the components, we have to handle the security groups :
  - Instance2 (NAT Instance) musts accept requests coming from Instance3's security group.
  - Instance3 musts accept requests coming from Instance1's security group.
  
After setting up the whole architecture, we can now connect to Instance1 using Putty(after converting the keypair extension).
Then we have to send this keypar to Instance1 ( in order to be able to connect to Instance3 ), we use WINSCP for this matter.
Finally, we can connect to Instance3 from Instance1 still using Putty, and we are able to ping google.com
